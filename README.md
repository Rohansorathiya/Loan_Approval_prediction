Loan approval prediction can be achieved through machine learning techniques.

LOANS are a significant requirement of the modern world. By this only, Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any luxury like houses, cars, etc.

But when deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.
